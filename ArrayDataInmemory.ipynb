    "Row-major and column-major ordering are special cases of strategies for mapping the index used to address an element, to the offset for the element in the array’s memory segment. In general, the NumPy array attribute ndarray.strides defines exactly how this mapping is done. The strides attribute is a tuple of the same length as the number of axes (dimensions) of the array. Each value in strides is the factor by which the index for the corresponding axis is multiplied when calculating the memory offset (in bytes) for a given index expression.\n",
